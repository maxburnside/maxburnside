                When I started creating Preview SMS, I imagined a quite small feature list and just enough functionality to prove that this concept is worth exploring. This was the initial to-do list:
                <br />
                <br />
                - Create initial React app
                <br />
                - Get Text input to update preview displays
                <br />
                - Show 3 different preview windows
                <br />
                - Display live character count of main input textarea
                <br />
                <br />
                If I were working on a feature for a larger application that was already in existence, these line items (outside of the create initial react app step) would be a great start to convincing stakeholders on the team that this is a feature we should explore more. It would be a coded prototype, effectively.
                <br />
                <br />
                But accomplishing these tasks was really a minimum viable product. And that’s the problem. It’s not even useful enough to ship.
                <br />
                <br />
                Up until about 10 years ago or so, MVPs functioned as part proof-of-concept, part pitch-deck-material. Get something working, however crude it looks, and show it to a bunch of people to validate your initial idea. That worked well to get investors excited about throwing money at problems that were being “solved” in front of potential customers. But if often left much to be desired.
                <br />
                <br />
                While I agree to a certain extent with the adage, “if you aren’t embarrassed by the first version of your product, then you waited too long to launch”, the flip side of that coin is “you only get one first impression, you should make it count”. In a world of fleeting attention spans, if your product doesn’t at least appear well-crafted, it’s tougher to get your audience to “wait for the improvements” or to convince them that “the next version is going to be great”.
                <br />
                <br />
                Nearly all of your target audience for any SaaS, B2B, or B2C product for has already experienced hundreds of high-quality native applications running on a smartphone that’s more powerful than the first (and, to date, only) car I’ve ever purchased - a 2014 base model VW Jetta with manual transmission. The bar is so much higher for product’s initial impressions that just about a decade and a half ago.
                <br />
                <br />
                With this in mind, I began to expand my feature list to try and find the right balance of only focusing on key features, but creating a v1 that’s polished enough to get people to keep using the product, even on launch day.

                        As 2023 winds down, there is discussion of how technology such as AI is changing our world. What I'm more surprised by, rather, is how a decades old technology has managed to stay relevant all these years later...
