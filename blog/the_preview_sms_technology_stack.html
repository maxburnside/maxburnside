                When building a product, there are a number of different services and technologies that need to be used in order to create the product in a timely manner as well as provide the best possible user experience. 
                <br />
                <br />
                Analytics: Google Analytics
                <br />
                Frontend: React, Headless UI
                <br />
                Backend: Next.js
                <br />
                Hosting: Netlify
                <br />
                CDN: Cloudinary
                <br />
                Version Control: GitHub
                <br />
                Payments: Stripe
                <br />

                <br />
                Product Management: Linear
                <br />
                Domains: Hover
                <br />
                Email: Google Suite
                <br />
                Marketing: Nothing currently - possibly ConvertKit in the future
                <br />
                Icons: Custom
                <br />
                Branding: Custom
                <br />
                <br />
                There is a lot made of technology stacks, what to do/not do, and which product/service combinations will yield the best results. I had to rebuild the app a few times to accommodate integrating certain services. Ideally, I would have “just known” which technologies I was going to use at the project outset, but that’s just part of the learning process.
                <br />
                <br />
                Reality is, I don’t know if I have the “right” technology stack. It will certainly evolve over time. Some technologies/services will be replaced by in-house built services or a competitor, while others will be removed altogether.
                <br />
                <br />
                I’ll be candid: part of the reason I chose certain technologies when building Preview SMS is that I aim to sell the company at some point. Building using a well-supported technology means I have more potential customers that could acquire my company. Another benefit, of course, is that there is a wider support community when trying to build the product. Chances are very good that not only has someone else found a solution for the problem(s) I’m solving, but that several people have found a solution and I can see the benefits of others’ different solutions when implementing my own.
                <br />
                <br />
                There is also the rationale that some of these frameworks/services are industry-leading for a good reason. They’ve simply built the best product and using them is basically a default decision. I’m okay admitting that. Being an industry leader can actually be helpful.

                        When I started creating Preview SMS, I imagined a quite small feature list and just enough functionality to prove that this concept is worth exploring. This was the initial to-do list...

                        As 2023 winds down, there is discussion of how technology such as AI is changing our world. What I'm more surprised by, rather, is how a decades old technology has managed to stay relevant all these years later...
