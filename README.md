# Hi, I'm Max Burnside.

### I'm a designer who's been creating well-crafted products for over a decade. 

### I recently launched a few applications:

1. <a href="https://homeplatedeals.com#github_referral">Home Plate Deals</a>: shows you which free food promotions are available for each MLB team, depending on how the team performed the previous day.
2. <a href="https://previewsms.com#github_referral" target="_blank">Preview SMS</a>: instantly shows you how recipients will see your messages.

### I'm working on <a href="https://github.com/maxburnside/subtle_ui">Subtle UI</a>, a free, open-source library of intuitive, accessible, and subtly beautiful web components.
