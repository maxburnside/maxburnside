# maxburnside_landing_page
My Personal Site: a nice, minimal landing page that houses links to my work.

The goal is to keep the codebase very small optimizing load times and performance.

There are no breakpoints for different device viewports, with the only media query applying styles to devices with dark mode preference enabled.
