# Personal Landing Page
A nice, minimal landing page that houses links to my work, and currently serves as my personal home page.

Goals for the page:

1. Keep the codebase very small, optimizing load times and performance.
2. Work equally well on all browsers and devices
3. Maintain a minimalist, but well-defined, aesthetic
4. Experiment with upcoming browser/web features, while maintaining fallback features for older browsers.
