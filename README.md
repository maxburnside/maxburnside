# maxburnside_landing_page
A nice, minimal landing page that houses links to my work, and currently serves as my personal home page.

Goals for the page:

1. Keep the codebase very small, optimizing load times and performance.
2. Work equally well on all browsers and devices
3. Maintain a minimalist, but well-defined, aesthetic
4. Experiment with upcoming browser/web features, while maintaining fallback features for older browsers.

There are no breakpoints for different device viewports, with the only media query utilized to apply dark mode styling on devices with a dark mode preference enabled.
